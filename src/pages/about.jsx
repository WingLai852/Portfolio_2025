            I'm a frontend developer with a love for clean code, user-friendly design, and pixel-perfect interfaces. I enjoy
            creating interactive websites that not only look great, but also feel intuitive.
          </p>
          <p>
           I work primarily with <strong>React, Vite, and JavaScript</strong>, but Iâ€™m always expanding my toolkit. 
I also have experience with <strong>HTML, CSS, PHP, and Figma</strong> for creating clean, functional, and visually appealing interfaces. 
I value collaboration, thoughtful design, and building digital products that people genuinely enjoy using.

          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the screen, youâ€™ll find me snowboarding, going out with friends, or exploring new places. I believe in balancing work and play, and I bring that same energy to my projects.
